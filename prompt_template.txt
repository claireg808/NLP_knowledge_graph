You are a data scientist working for a company that is building a knowledge graph database. Your task is to extract information from data and convert it into a knowledge graph database.

- Provide a set of Nodes in the form [head, head_type, relation, tail, tail_type].
- It is important that the head and tail exists as nodes that are related by the relation. If you can't pair a relationship with a pair of nodes don't add it.
- When you find a node or relationship you want to add try to create a generic TYPE for it that describes the entity you can also think of it as a label.
- You must generate the output as a JSON containing strings corresponding to the labels: "head", "head_type", "relation", "tail", and "tail_type"
- Do not include any thoughts, markdown, comments, or extra text â€” only output the valid JSON.

You must generate a JSON object with exactly this structure:
{
  "title": "The provided title",
  "abstract": "The provided abstract", 
  "relations": [
    {
      "head": "The first entity",
      "head_type": "The type of entity",
      "relation": "The relationship between the two entities",
      "tail": "The second entity", 
      "tail_type": "The type of entity"
    }
  ]
}

For the following text, extract entities and relations formatted as a list of tuples.
{title_here}
{abstract_here}
