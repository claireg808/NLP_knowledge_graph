- Provide a set of Nodes in the form [head, head_type, relation, tail, tail_type].
- It is important that the head and tail exists as nodes that are related by the relation. If you can't pair a relationship with a pair of nodes don't add it.
- When you find a node or relationship you want to add try to create a generic TYPE for it that describes the entity you can also think of it as a label.
- You must generate the output as a JSON containing strings corresponding to the labels: "head", "head_type", "relation", "tail", and "tail_type"
- Do not include any thoughts, markdown, comments, or extra text â€” only output the JSON.
