  "abstract": "The emergent recognition of the gut-brain axis connection has shed light on the role of the microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis's functions. Several microbial metabolites, such as serotonin, kynurenine, tryptamine, indole, and their derivatives originating from tryptophan metabolism have been implicated in influencing this axis. In our study, we aimed to investigate the impact of running exercises on microbial tryptophan metabolism using a mouse model. We conducted a multi-omics analysis to obtain a comprehensive insight into the changes in tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis induced by running exercises. The analyses integrated multiple components, such as tryptophan changes and metabolite levels in the gut, blood, hippocampus, and brainstem. Fecal microbiota analysis aimed to examine the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota, and taxon-function analysis explored the associations between specific microbial taxa and functional activities in tryptophan metabolism. Our findings revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism across multiple sites, including the gut, blood, hippocampus, and brainstem. The outcomes indicate a shift in microbiota diversity and tryptophan metabolizing capabilities within the running group, linked to increased tryptophan transportation to the hippocampus and brainstem through circulation. Moreover, the symbiotic association between <i>Romboutsia</i> and <i>A. muciniphila</i> indicated their potential contribution to modifying the gut microenvironment and influencing tryptophan transport to the hippocampus and brainstem. These findings have potential applications for developing microbiota-based approaches in the context of exercise for neurological diseases, especially on mental health and overall well-being.",
