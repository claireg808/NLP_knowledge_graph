  "title": "Targeting the gut-microbiota-brain axis in irritable bowel disease to improve cognitive function - recent knowledge and emerging therapeutic opportunities",
  "abstract": "The brain-gut axis forms a bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and cognitive brain areas. Disturbances to this system in disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease have consequences for neuronal activity and subsequent cognitive function. The gut-microbiota-brain axis refers to the communication between gut-resident bacteria and the brain. This circuits exists to detect gut microorganisms and relay information to specific areas of the central nervous system (CNS) that in turn, regulate gut physiology. Changes in both the stability and diversity of the gut microbiota have been implicated in several neuronal disorders, including depression, autism spectrum disorder Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Correcting this imbalance with medicinal herbs, the metabolic products of dysregulated bacteria and probiotics have shown hope for the treatment of these neuronal disorders. In this review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the intricate connections between the gut-microbiota and the brain. We discuss the contribution of gut microbiota to neuronal disorders and the tangible links between diseases of the GI tract with cognitive function and behaviour. In this regard, we focus on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) given its strong links to brain function and anxiety disorders. This adds to the growing body of evidence supporting targeted therapeutic strategies to modulate the gut microbiota for the treatment of brain/mental-health-related disease.",
