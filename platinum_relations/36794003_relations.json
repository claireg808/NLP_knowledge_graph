  "title": "High-fiber diet ameliorates gut microbiota, serum metabolism and emotional mood in type 2 diabetes patients.",
  "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often had the problems of fecal microbiota dysbiosis, and were usually accompanied with psychiatric comorbidities (such as depression and anxiety). Here, we conducted a randomized clinical study to analyze the changes in gut microbiota, serum metabolism and emotional mood of patients with T2DM after consumption of a high-fiber diet. The glucose homeostasis of participants with T2DM was improved by the high-fiber diet, and the serum metabolome, systemic inflammation and psychiatric comorbidities were also altered. The increased abundances of <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Akkermansias</i> revealed that the proportions of beneficial gut microbes were enriched by the high-fiber diet, while the abundances of <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i> and other opportunistic pathogens were decreased. Therefore, the current study demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota alterations which were influenced by the high-fiber diet could improve the serum metabolism and emotional mood of patients with T2DM.",
