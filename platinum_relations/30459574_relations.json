  "abstract": "In recent years, a burgeoning body of research has revealed links between depression and the gut microbiota, leading to the therapeutic use of probiotics for stress-related disorders. In this study, we explored the potential antidepressant efficacy of a multi-strain probiotics treatment (<i>Lactobacillus helveticus R0052</i>, <i>Lactobacillus plantarum R1012</i>, and <i>Bifidobacterium longum R0175</i>) in a chronic mild stress (CMS) mouse model of depression and determined its probable mechanism of action. Our findings revealed that mice subjected to CMS exhibited anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in the sucrose preference test, elevated plus maze, and forced swim test, along with increased interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 levels in the hippocampus. Moreover, the microbiota distinctly changed from the non-stress group and was characterized by highly diverse bacterial communities associated with significant reductions in <i>Lactobacillus</i> species. Probiotics attenuated CMS-induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, significantly increased <i>Lactobacillus</i> abundance, and reversed the CMS-induced immune changes in the hippocampus. Thus, the possible mechanism involved in the antidepressant-like activity of probiotics is correlated with <i>Lactobacillus</i> species via the gut microbiota-inflammation-brain axis.",
