    - Create a new virtual environment: python -m venv myenv 
        - Replace "myenv" with your desired name
    - Activate the environment to install necessary dependencies:
        - source myenv/bin/activate

    - Run the following script first to get deepseek running
        -sbatch run.sh
    
    - Check the job status in output_serve.log: tail -f output_serve.log
        -  Wait for this line to appear: INFO:     Application startup complete.

    -Once that is done run the prompt script: sbatch generate_json.sh
    


    -To check the current hickory queue: squeue
    -To cancel your job: scancel <job number>

NOTE: DO NOT CALL ANY OF THIS DEEPSEEK THIS IS DS EVERYTIME
also less important note: the first few samples from the dev file were used as examples for the tagged sample
not sure that this is an issue now given how bad at tagging it is but if we wanted to make it more official 
we should either take those samples out of the files we are testing it on or replace ecxample dev tagged samples
with something from test/train or something like that
